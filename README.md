# Dockerfile

## Reference
The Dockerfile is based on https://github.com/joomla/docker-joomla/tree/master/php7.3/fpm-alpine

## What changed from the "official" Dockerfile?

### Base Image
The base image has been changed to php:7.3.5-fpm-alpine3.9 as the tag is more specific and it will offer repeatable builds than php:7.3-fpm-alpine (which is the tag in the original code).

### New Argument
Added a new argument JOOMLA_VERSION
```
ARG JOOMLA_VERSION
```
in order to parametrize the build

## Building a new image
The following command will build the Docker image and push it to Dockerhub.
Note: this assumes you have already successfully authenticated using `docker login`
```
./build.sh <version>
```
Example:
```
./build.sh 3.9.6
```

# Database
The database is deployed independently from Joomla
https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/mariadb

```
read -s MARIADB_PASSWORD && \
kubectl create secret generic joomla-db --from-literal=mariadb-root-password=${MARIADB_PASSWORD}
```

To verify the content of the secret
```
kubectl get secret --namespace default joomla-db -o jsonpath="{.data.mariadb-root-password}"| base64 --decode
```

Deploy MariaDB using a custom value file
```
helm install stable/mariadb --name joomla-db --version 6.0.1 -f helm/maria-db/values.yaml
```

# Configure Joomla

## Database
Use `joomla-db-mariadb` for the 'Host Name' (which is the name of the k8s service), and `joomla` as the 'Database Name' field

## Deploy using Helm

If Tiller is not deployed, it can be started locally (which is in line with the proposal for Helm 3, which aims to remove Tiller)
https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/securing_installation.md#running-tiller-locally
```
tiller --storage=configmap
```

In another terminal, export the HELM_HOST variable (can be included in .bashrc to avoid repeating this step)
```
export HELM_HOST=:44134
```

Assuming the CD pipeline will inject the environment variable
```
helm install helm/demo-joomla/ --name demo-joomla-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) --set mariadb.password=${MARIADB_PASSWORD}
```

If the deployment must be triggered manually
```
read -s MARIADB_PASSWORD && \
helm install helm/demo-joomla/ --name demo-joomla-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) --set mariadb.password=${MARIADB_PASSWORD}
```


# demo-joomla service

Create the service using
```
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```

This service is outside of the chart in order to allow blue/green deployments by modifying its selector.

Expose the service locally using port-forward
```
kubectl port-forward svc/demo-joomla  8080:8080
```
